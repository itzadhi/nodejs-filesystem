# Node File System

I have created API's by using node js to interact with file system module, where you can create a file and read all files in the directory.

## Local Setup

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/itzadhi/nodejs-filesystem.git
```

```sh
$ cd nodejs-filesystem
```

```sh
$ npm install
```

```sh
$ npm run server
```
